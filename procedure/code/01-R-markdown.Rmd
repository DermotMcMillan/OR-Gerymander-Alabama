# Study design

This is an original study based on literature on gerrymandering metrics.

It is an exploratory study to evaluate the usefulness of a new gerrymandering metric based on the convex hull and representativeness inside the convex hull compareed to the congressional district.

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

I plan on using sf tidyverse and tidycensus packages for my spatial analysis.

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "sf", "tmap", "lwgeom", "tidycensus","knitr", "htmltools", "markdown", "GGally")

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2025-02-01"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

# record the R processing environment
# alternatively, use devtools::session_info() for better results
writeLines(
  capture.output(sessionInfo()),
  here("procedure", "environment", paste0("r-environment-", Sys.Date(), ".txt"))
)

# save package citations
knitr::write_bib(c(packages, "base"), file = here("software.bib"))

# set up default knitr parameters
# https://yihui.org/knitr/options/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, # Run code, show outputs (don't show code)
  fig.retina = 4,
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.path = paste0(here("results", "figures"), "/")
)
```

## Data and variables

### Precincts 2020

```{r}
includeMarkdown(here("data", "metadata", "precincts20.md"))
```

### Districts 2023

```{r}
includeMarkdown(here("data", "metadata", "districts23.md"))
```

```{r load districts}
districts_file <- here("data", "raw", "public", "districts.gpkg")
st_layers(districts_file)
districts23 <- st_read(districts_file, layer="districts23")
```

```{r display districts}
districtPlot <- ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = districts23, fill = NA, color = "darkred", lwd = 0.5) +
theme_void() +
geom_sf_text(data = districts23, aes(label = DISTRICT), size = 5, color = "red")
districtPlot
```


### Decennial Census

```{r}
includeMarkdown(here("data", "metadata", "blockgroups2020.md"))
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
census_metadata_file <- here("data", "metadata", "census2020pl_vars.csv")
if(file.exists(census_metadata_file)){
  census2020pl_vars <- read.csv(census_metadata_file)
} else {
  census2020pl_vars <- load_variables(2020, "pl")
  write.csv(census2020pl_vars, here("data", "metadata", "census2020pl_vars.csv"))
}
```

We are interested in Racial gerrymandering so we will look at voting aged people who are Black or African American.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
blockgroup_file <- here("data", "raw", "public", "block_groups.gpkg")

# if the data is already downloaded, just load it
# otherwise, query from the census and save
if(file.exists(blockgroup_file)){
  blockgroups <- st_read(blockgroup_file)
} else {
  blockgroups <- get_decennial(geography = "block group",
                               sumfile = "pl",
                               table = "P3",
                               year = 2020,
                               state = "Alabama",
                               output = "wide",
                               geometry = TRUE,
                               keep_geo_vars = TRUE)
  st_write(blockgroups, blockgroup_file)
}
```

## Prior observations

At the time of this study pre-registration, the authors had no prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the spatial and political phenomena to be studied.
This study is related to no prior studies by the authors

## Bias and threats to validity

This study deals with the modifiable areal unit problem since it is looking at how changing the areal unit 
changes the political and social demographics in a region.
Coastlines and other borders formed by natural features may generate very different compactness scores depending on the scale at which the perimeter is calculated and may lead to biased results in the convex hull and minimum bounding circle comparisons.

## Data transformations

The following is a general workflow diagram for data transformations boxes represent transformations and circles represent outputs.

![Workflow](`r here("procedure", "code", "GerryWorkflow.png")`)

### Districts 2023

```{r calculate pct Black}
districts23 <- districts23 %>%
mutate(pctBlack = round(BLACK / POPULATION * 100, 1))
```

### Block Groups (Decennial Cencus)

```{r set crs}
blockgroups <- st_transform(blockgroups, 4269)
```

```{r find variables including "Black"}
black_vars <- census2020pl_vars %>%
dplyr::filter(str_detect(name, "P3"),
str_detect(label, "Black")) %>%
select(-concept)
black_vars %>% kable()
```

```{r calculate pct Black}
blockgroups_calc <- blockgroups %>%
mutate(Black = rowSums(across(all_of(black_vars$name)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
mutate(bgarea = st_area(geom),
Total = P3_001N,
PctBlack = Black / Total * 100,
CheckPct = (Black + P3_003N) / Total * 100
) %>%
select(GEOID, bgarea, Black, Total, PctBlack, CheckPct)
st_write(blockgroups_calc,
here("data", "derived", "public", "blockgroups_calc.gpkg"),
append=FALSE)
```

```{r plot pct Black by blockgroup}
pctBlackPlot <- ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = blockgroups_calc, aes(fill = PctBlack), lwd = 0) +
theme_void() +
scale_fill_viridis_b(option = "mako",
                     direction = -1,
                     begin = 0.2,
                     breaks = seq(0, 100, length.out = 6))
pctBlackPlot
```

```{r plot pct Black w/ districts}
pctBlackPlot + districtPlot$layers
```


## Analysis

Describe the methods of analysis that will directly test the hypotheses or provide results to answer the research questions.
This section should explicitly define any spatial / statistical *models* and their *parameters*, including *grouping* criteria, *weighting* criteria, and *significance thresholds*.
Also explain any follow-up analyses or validations.

```{r}
districts23_estimates <- st_intersection(blockgroups_calc, districts23) |> 
  mutate(
    awTot = Total * as.numeric(st_area(geom) / bgarea),
    awBlack = Black * as.numeric(st_area(geom) / bgarea)
  ) |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  group_by(DISTRICT) |> 
  summarize(bgTotal = sum(awTot),
            bgBlack = sum(awBlack))

districts23_join_bg <- districts23 |> 
  left_join(districts23_estimates, by = "DISTRICT") |> 
  mutate(pctBlackbg = round(bgBlack / bgTotal * 100, 1))
```

```{r}
districts23_join_bg |> st_drop_geometry() |> kable()
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
districts23_estimates <- st_intersection(blockgroups_calc, st_convex_hull(districts23)) |> 
  mutate(
    awTot = Total * as.numeric(st_area(geom) / bgarea),
    awBlack = Black * as.numeric(st_area(geom) / bgarea)
  ) |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  group_by(DISTRICT) |> 
  summarize(chTotal = sum(awTot),
            chBlack = sum(awBlack))
```

Join convex hull estimates to Districts with block-group estimates.

```{r}
districts23_join_ch <- districts23_join_bg |> 
  left_join(districts23_estimates, by = "DISTRICT") |> 
  mutate(pctBlackch = round(chBlack / chTotal * 100, 1),
         diffPct = pctBlackbg - pctBlackch,
         absdiffPct = abs(diffPct))
```

Calculate compactness scores based on:

- the area and perimeter
- the area and the area of the convex hull
- the area and the area of the minimum bounding circle


```{r}
districts23_results <- districts23_join_ch |> 
  mutate(
    darea = st_area(geom),
    dperim = st_length(st_cast(geom, "MULTILINESTRING")),
#    dperim2 = st_perimeter(geom),
    compact_shp = round( as.numeric((4 * pi * darea) / dperim^2), 2),
    compact_hull = round( as.numeric(darea / st_area(st_convex_hull(geom))), 2),
    compact_circ = round( as.numeric(darea / st_area(st_minimum_bounding_circle(geom))), 2)
  )
```

# Results

```{r}
districts23_results_cor <- districts23_results |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  select(pctBlackbg,
         diffPct,
         absdiffPct,
         compact_shp,
         compact_hull,
         compact_circ)

districts23_results_cor |> cor() |> kable()
```

```{r}
districts23_results_cor |> ggpairs()
```

```{r}
districts23_results_plot <- districts23_results %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(DISTRICT, pctBlack, absdiffPct, compact_shp, compact_hull, compact_circ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("compact"))

districts23_results_plot %>% ggplot() +
  aes(x = absdiffPct, y = value) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", col = "grey30") +
  geom_label(aes(label = DISTRICT, fill = pctBlack)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(type = "div", palette = "PRGn") +

  facet_wrap(~name)
```
